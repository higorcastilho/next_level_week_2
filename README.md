### About

**Proffy** was a project developed from 03/08 to 07/08 by Rocketseat at second Next Level Week edition. It's a web app made to connect teachers and students who love to share and learn about several topics.

### New Features

The **challenge** now is to add new features to this app. I've been adding some of them on web version: 

- Users authentication with bcrypt and JWT
- Logout 
- Reponsive and mobile friendly pages (Login, Register, TeacherList, Success register page, Change Password etc)
- Editable user profile page
- Lading page with user header photo, name and logout button
- Password recovery
- Paginated API to classes list
- Change password and email
- Teacher list displaying each teacher schedule (with horizontal scroll on mobile)
- Now each teacher can teach different subjects
