###  This was a project developed from 03/08 to 07/08 by Rocketseat.
###  The challenge now is to add new features to this app. I've been adding some of them on web version: 

- Users authentication with bcrypt and JWT
- Logout 
- Reponsive and mobile friendly Login, Register and Success Register pages 
- Editable user profile page
- Lading page with user header photo, name and logout button
